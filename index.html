        I am a computer science major, however i have been considering specializing into cloud engineering/computing.
        I really love games almost any game is something i'll play. whether its a board game, sport, video game. However i prefer playing with people my own skill level. sorry no athletes here.
        I am 100% single.
        web design is going to be helpful in teaching me how to create helpful user interfaces throughout computer software.
        I have been a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints since i was born, and was baptized at 8 years old.
