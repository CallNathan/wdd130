        Stellar engines is a game that takes place in space.  It is intended to be a 100 player battle royale type game where players fight eachother not with guns and ammo,
        but with starships and space weaponry. Specifically it'll take place in low to high earth orbit in the far future where the fight for resources reaches unparralled levels
        of extreames, and the only places left with resources left to scavange is space debris, each player fights to secure these resources for themselves. 
        by visiting or traveling to satellites or space debris deposits players can scavange and retrieve materials and old technology modules to upgrade and improve their ship systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ships will all be standardized by some unknown entity that all the players are recruited by, with the main inspiration for these standard models being the mining pods from 
        Guardians Of The Galaxy. (image 1) These pods will be initially spherical and come equipped with a very basic Electron Beam weapon, armor and energy shield system to begin.
        However potential upgrades could turn your humble little pod into battleships of massive size and scale of devastation. Armor Upgrades to improve your chances of survival
        Shield upgrades to protect critical systems,  Weapon upgrades to allow you to punch through these armor and shield systems.  The harder these modules are to obtain the stronger
        they could be.  finding a shield module in a random pile of scrap is going to be weaker then one you find in an abandoned research satellite, which will be weaker then one you 
        aquire by destroying pirate ships that are strewn around the map.  These pirates will use the same standard as the players but will start the game with preinstalled upgrades.
        This does mean you need to destroy a ship that might have stronger weapons, shields, and armor then yourself. but the more difficult the fight the higher the rewards could be.
        and of course the most powerful of upgrades would be located on fully operational battlestations that would be incredably difficult to beat but provide weapons that will shred.
        all of those inferior systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upgrade modules will be categorized by an alpha-numeric system going from F to A and then I and S.  where F is the worst module you can find and A is the best module you can find.
        I class modules stand for Initial class modules and this category is only for the 3 components you start with. S class Modules stand for Superior class modules these are the kinds
        of modules you get from killing fully operational battlestations or the very rare pirate ship.  Some modules wont ever have low tier categories, and some can only be a low tier
        module.

      <h3>Gameplay Elements</h3>
      <p>
        When a player aquires a new module, it takes time to refit the ship with the module, depending on the rarity and type of module it could take a shorter or a longer amount of time to 
        install. Also while the module is being installed the system it belongs to will be disabled. For example when installing a shield module, your shields will no longer be available. 
        when installing a weapon module, that weapon slot is no longer active. The only exception is Armor modules, when installing a new armor module you don't have 0 armor your armor 
        will be reduced by the following equation (AP = NP - (T% * (NP - OP))) Where AP is your new armor points, NP is the armor points the new module provides, T is the time remaining on 
        the upgrade module. in a percent.  This should reduce the amount of Armor you have while upgrading by an amount that correlates to the amount of time left in the upgrade and the 
        difference in the armor that the upgrades provide.  This does mean you are most vulnerable at the beginning of the upgrade and slowly get all of your armor back over time.  Fortunatly 
        you have shields to allow you both time and durability while your armor is upgrading, and you have armor while your shields are being installed.  and each ship has at least 2 weapon 
        slots so while one is being upgraded you have at least one other to fend off enemies with.
      </p>
      <p>
        When shields are finshed installing they are immediately deployed, as the the time it takes for the shield to activate is included in the install time,  However when a shield is broken 
        it will wait 5 seconds, then will recharge shields at a rate defined by (SP = SP + 5 + SPB) where SP is shield points, and SPB is a bonus to your shield regeneration provided by your 
        shield module. 5 shields per second is the default.  this does mean every 5 seconds you will gain a barrier that can absorb an attack as shields can completely negate 100% of an attack 
        regardless of how much damage it does when the shield hits 0 SP.  Unless the weapon Specifically counters this aspect. Every time your shield is broken there is a 5 second delay before 
        it is redeployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When weapons are finsihed installing they are immediately ready to be used, as reload times are included in the initial install timer.  When weapons are used they have unique firing rates, 
        reload times, weapon types, and damages unique to each weapon.  This does mean for weapons with a long reload time, they also have a longer install time. The table below shows each weapon, 
        it's class, it's fire rate, Ammo Capacity, reload time, weapon type, and its damages.
        <table>
          <tr>
