            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p id="Paragraph1">
                Stellar engines is a game that takes place in space.  It is intended to be a 100 player battle royale type game where players fight eachother not with guns and ammo,
                but with starships and space weaponry. Specifically it'll take place in low to high earth orbit in the far future where the fight for resources reaches unparralled levels
                of extreames, and the only places left with resources left to scavange is space debris, each player fights to secure these resources for themselves. 
                by visiting or traveling to satellites or space debris deposits players can scavange and retrieve materials and old technology modules to upgrade and improve their ship systems.

            <h2>standardized Ship Models</h2>
            <p id="Paragraph2">
                Ships will all be standardized by some unknown entity that all the players are recruited by, with the main inspiration for these standard models being the mining pods from 
                Guardians Of The Galaxy. (image 1) These pods will be initially spherical and come equipped with a very basic Electron Beam weapon, armor and energy shield system to begin.
                However potential upgrades could turn your humble little pod into battleships of massive size and scale of devastation. Armor Upgrades to improve your chances of survival
                Shield upgrades to protect critical systems,  Weapon upgrades to allow you to punch through these armor and shield systems.  The harder these modules are to obtain the stronger
                they could be.  finding a shield module in a random pile of scrap is going to be weaker then one you find in an abandoned research satellite, which will be weaker then one you 
                aquire by destroying pirate ships that are strewn around the map.  These pirates will use the same standard as the players but will start the game with preinstalled upgrades.
                This does mean you need to destroy a ship that might have stronger weapons, shields, and armor then yourself. but the more difficult the fight the higher the rewards could be.
                and of course the most powerful of upgrades would be located on fully operational battlestations that would be incredably difficult to beat but provide weapons that will shred.
                all of those inferior systems.

            <h2>standardized Classification Systems</h2>
            <p id="Paragraph3">
                Upgrade modules will be categorized by an alpha-numeric system going from F to A and then I and S.  where F is the worst module you can find and A is the best module you can find.
                I class modules stand for Initial class modules and this category is only for the 3 components you start with. S class Modules stand for Superior class modules these are the kinds
                of modules you get from killing fully operational battlestations or the very rare pirate ship.  Some modules wont ever have low tier categories, and some can only be a low tier
                module.
