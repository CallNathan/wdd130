            <h2>Hull Points, Armor points and Shield points</h2>
            <h3>Hull points</h3>
            <p>
                Players will have 3 types of health bars, each one has its own unique interactions and penalties attached to them.  The first two are Hull Points (HP)
                 And Armor points (AP).  These are very similar to eachother with only two major differences.  Hull Points take average damage from weapons. The Hull is 
                 imbued with energy based circutry and protections as well as standard grade steel plating, however when the hull takes damage certain ship systems start 
                 failing.  when hull is 50% depleted 50% of your weapon systems will fall offline, below 25% your ship weapons will fail and any combat regeneration you have 
                 is disabled. below 10% your engine has gone critical, your thruster upgrades will no longer work. and of course at 0% hull your ship can no longer withstand 
                 the vacumme of space and will explode.  If you manage to emerge victorious or manage to escape your enemy, the hull is equipped with secondary repair systems 
                 that will slowly repair your hull and any systems that fell offline.
            </p>
            <h3>Armor Points</h3>
            <p>
                Armor on the other hand, has none of those downsides, you can take as much armor damage as you want without penalties to your ship systems.  However, armor 
                is 100% metal plating, as such energy based weapons can absolutely shred your armor points.  additionally armor is heavy, depending on how much you equip you 
                may find that your thrusters will struggle to move your ship.  Even though thrust in space is guarenteed, when you wheigh more it takes longer to get moving.  
                Additionally Armor points cannot regenerate naturally,  if you want to restore your armor, you'll need to uninstall the module and reinstall it.  Certain 
                upgrade modules can enable active repairing, but they'll likely be slow and unable to do so while under fire.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Shields
            </h3>
            <p>
                Shields are the most versitile of the three health bars.  able to absorb damage like armor, withstand energy weapons, and regenerate while active it is a must have in space combat.  
                However Shields are not without their disadvantages, Kinetic or peircing based weapons can break a shield in a moment, peircing especially.  when hit by a piercing 
                attack the shields energy absorbtion fails, allowing attacks to continue through the shield and hit the armor or hull.  Shields are a must have, but there are 
                many ways to work around them.  
            </p>

            <h2>Refit times</h2>
            <p>
                When a player aquires a new module, it takes time to refit the ship with the module, depending on the rarity and type of module it could take a shorter or a longer amount of time to 
                install. Also while the module is being installed the system it belongs to will be disabled. For example when installing a shield module, your shields will no longer be available. 
                when installing a weapon module, that weapon slot is no longer active. The only exception is Armor modules, when installing a new armor module you don't have 0 armor your armor 
                will be reduced by the following equation (AP = NP - (T% * (NP - OP))) Where AP is your new armor points, NP is the armor points the new module provides, T is the time remaining on 
                the upgrade module. in a percent.  This should reduce the amount of Armor you have while upgrading by an amount that correlates to the amount of time left in the upgrade and the 
                difference in the armor that the upgrades provide.  This does mean you are most vulnerable at the beginning of the upgrade and slowly get all of your armor back over time.  Fortunatly 
                you have shields to allow you both time and durability while your armor is upgrading, and you have armor while your shields are being installed.  and each ship has at least 2 weapon 
                slots so while one is being upgraded you have at least one other to fend off enemies with.
            </p>
            <h2>Preloaded weaponry</h2>
            <p>
                When weapons are finsihed installing they are immediately ready to be used, as reload times are included in the initial install timer.  When weapons are used they have unique firing rates, 
                reload times, weapon types, and damages unique to each weapon.  This does mean for weapons with a long reload time, they also have a longer install time. The table below shows each weapon, 
                it's class, it's fire rate, Ammo Capacity, reload time, weapon type, and its damages.
